# Java Type Conversion Examples
=============================

This repository contains two Java programs that demonstrate automatic and explicit type conversion in Java.

### Description

The two programs, `AutoType.java` and `ExplicitType.java`, showcase how Java performs type conversion between different data types.

### Automatic Type Conversion

The `AutoType.java` program demonstrates automatic type conversion, where Java implicitly converts a value from one data type to another. The program converts an `int` value to a `long` value and then to a `float` value, showcasing how Java performs automatic type conversion.

### Explicit Type Conversion

The `ExplicitType.java` program demonstrates explicit type conversion, where the programmer explicitly casts a value from one data type to another using a cast operator. The program converts a `double` value to a `long` value and then to an `int` value, showcasing how Java performs explicit type conversion.

### Technologies Used

* Java 22
* Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers (includes Incubating components)
* Version: 2024-03 (4.31.0)
* Build id: 20240307-1437

### Running the Programs

To run the programs, simply compile and execute the `AutoType` and `ExplicitType` classes.
